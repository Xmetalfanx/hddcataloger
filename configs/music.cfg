## music (no caps) will be the music directory in the hdd's root folder ... anything different should be renamed

# Christmas stuff will not be sorted in this config .. again this is an IDEA
# tgc audio will not be sorted here as that is in a "/tgc/audio" root dev
# audiobooks MAY be sorted here


# here for now but this may be moved to the univeral.cfg file later
# this is for the subdir search
function getMusicDirList()
{
    # takes dir names you want to check for as arguements... at least ones you'd want to have a sorted sub_catagory files
    # checkForDir is an array of directory names to search for

# ?? how do things change with the new universal  functions that I didn't have before?
