with Podcasts and Audiobooks, they:

- should be in the root level folder
- the names (subdir's on level 1) are unknown but those names are the NAMES OF the podcast or audiobook


function audiobookAndPodcasts {

    ## ls -d "Audiobooks" "podcasts"
    foobar=$(ls -d "Audiobooks" "podcasts")


    # idea: assign the ls command above to a var
    ## do a for-in loop, where the var is the "in" part

    for results in
