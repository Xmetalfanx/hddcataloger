## To avoid alot of un-needed code i am going to rename all show directories to "tvshows" and movie directories to "movies"
## no caps ... or case difference ... exactly what i just said 


# set something up for TTC content too 
# For Movie and Shows - Catagories each one to their own file 


currentdate=${date +"%B_%d_%Y"}

# October_24_2020



# EXCLUDE - jpg, png, xfo (?)
# -I to Ignore 

# INCLUDE - Mp4, MKV, webm?, mov? 
# -P to include 


# --dirsfirst   List directories before files (-U disables).

# example - tree -af -I "*.jpg" -P "*.mp4" --dirsfirst
# example - tree -I "*.jpg" -P "*.mp4"
