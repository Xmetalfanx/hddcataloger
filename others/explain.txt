Basically I have an if statement like the following

$dir var's below are paths, for this explaination I am keeping it simple


if [[ -d "$dirA" ] || [ -d "$dirB" ] || [ -d "$dirC" ]]; then 
    ** the key and what is confusing me ... 
    note: THESE ARE "ORs" between each check and IF ONE triggers only one should trigger (as "true")

    What I want: to grab the one that triggers as true and assign it to a variable

    say (ignore the horrible var name)

    dirExistVar=$dirB 

    I dont want to grab the other two that do not apply ... I thought of maybe something like checking "$?" but that doesn't make sense to me.
    
    Wouldn't that just say like "true" (or that via 0 and 1)? ... I want to know which one triggered not IF one triggered.
    
    The fact that I am in that part of the if statement would tell me that something triggered of course
