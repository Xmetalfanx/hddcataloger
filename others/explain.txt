Basically I have an if statement like the following

$dir var's below are paths, for this explaination I am keeping it simple


if [[ -d "$dirA" ] || [ -d "$dirB" ] || [ -d "$dirC" ]]; then 

    What I want: to grab the one that triggers as true and assign it to a variable ... say (ignore the horrible var name)

    dirExistVar=$dirB 

    not all of the or's would trigger either ... just one of the three for example.

    and this has nothing really to do with it but all vars in this example (the dirExistVar one is just assigning the value of one to another) are path's ... "dir" = directory
